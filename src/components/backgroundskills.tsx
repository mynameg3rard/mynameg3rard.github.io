                    <p>Learning from each and every mistake is my philosophy. That's how I am always trying to create new businesses, being Self-Employed as a part-time job since I was 18 years.</p>
                    <p>I've been playing with robotics, 3D printing and computers since I was a child. I have a good eye for photography, my main hobby, as well as playing the guitar on my spare time.</p>
