                    <li><h3>YerAni Pallets</h3></li>
                    <p>A new wholesell business of liquidation stocks from Germany and Amazon Returns from Spain.</p>

                    <li><h3>PlantBak.com</h3></li>
                    <p>A cashback webpage that plants trees and gives prizes for every purchase made on it. The idea was great and we already had hundreds of shopping sites affiliated (such as PCComponentes, Leroy Merlin, Nike, Just Eat, AliExpress and many many more). The lack of marketing budget led to the fall of the project after a few months.</p>

                    <li><h3>Lampcat</h3></li>
                    <p>A brand of holographic RGB LED Lamps, our first attempt to sell on Amazon FBA. With just a few hundred of LED lamps from a Chinese provider, we learned the A to Z rules of selling on Amazon. The most important lesson we learned is that only the biggest wholesellers can survive among that site.</p>

                    <li><h3>Descomptes.cat</h3></li>
                    <p>The first website featuring Amazon deals in Catalan language. Our very first affiliate's marketing site, focused on the Catalan niche.</p>

                    <li><h3>@mynameg3rard</h3></li>
                    <p>My sports photographer account, following Girona FC during the past 5 years, with a grown +3000 followers community.</p>
